Title: Entry-way rules (eNTRy) for gram-negative bacteria
Description: 'The eNTRy rules are a set of three simple criteria for predicting compound accumulation in gram-negative bacteria.
  These rules were derived from a large dataset of compound accumulation in Escherichia coli and have been shown to be effective in guiding the design of compounds with improved permeability and accumulation in gram-negative bacteria.
  The eNTRy rules state that compounds are more likely to accumulate in gram-negative bacteria if they possess the following properties: (1) a low globularity (≤ 0.25), (2) a low number of rotatable bonds (≤ 5), and (3) the presence of a primary amine group.

- Score
Output Dimension: 3
Output Consistency: Fixed
Interpretation: 'Three binary outputs indicating whether the compound meets each of the eNTRy rules, namely low globularity, low number of rotatable bonds, and presence of a primary amine group.
  A value of 1 indicates that the compound meets the respective criterion, while a value of 0 indicates that it does not.'
