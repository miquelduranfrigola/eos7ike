Title: Entry-way rules for gram-negative bacteria
Description: Most small molecules are unable to rapidly traverse the outer membrane
  of Gram-negative bacteria and accumulate inside these cells, making the discovery
  of much-needed drugs against these pathogens challenging. Here we assess the ability
  of over 180 diverse compounds to accumulate in Escherichia coli. Computational analysis
  of the results reveals major differences from the retrospective studies, namely
  that the small molecules that are most likely to accumulate contain an amine, are
  amphiphilic and rigid, and have low globularity.
